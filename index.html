  <h2>Common Queries</h2>
  <p><strong>1) What is your curriculum?</strong><br>
  Our curriculum is designed to be both challenging and engaging, catering to diverse learning styles. We follow the ICSE curriculum, enhanced with innovative teaching methodologies and experiential learning opportunities. At our school, we don't believe in the tuition culture. We strongly feel that if students still need tuitions after attending school, then what's the point of school education?</p>

  We have a team of highly qualified and experienced teachers who are passionate about education. Our teachers are dedicated to providing personalized attention to each student and creating a supportive learning environment. They regularly participate in professional development programs to stay updated with the latest teaching practices.</p>

  <p><strong>3) How safe is the school?</strong><br>
  The safety and security of our students are our top priorities. We have implemented comprehensive security measures, including CCTV surveillance, security personnel, and controlled access to the school premises. We also conduct regular safety drills and awareness programs to ensure that our students are well-prepared for any emergency.</p>
