        <h2>Photon International School, Kaithal</h2>
        <p><strong>Photon International School</strong> is Kaithal’s premium ICSE school, offering classes from Nursery to Class 7 and expanding yearly to Class 12. With experienced teachers, a safe and nurturing campus, and a strong focus on overall development — including skills, confidence, and character — Photon is the trusted choice for parents seeking a future-ready education.</p>
        <p>📢 <strong>Admissions Open for the 2025–26 Academic Session!</strong></p>

        <h3>Enter to Learn, Leave to Lead</h3>
        <p>We focus on the <strong>overall development</strong> of every child — not just marks. Many schools today prioritise easy exams to produce <strong>“high-percentage, low-skill”</strong> learners. At Photon, we build <strong>high-skill, confident individuals</strong> who can think, communicate, and lead.</p>
        <p>Education should be like a <strong>tree with strong roots</strong>: when the base is solid — in academics, skills and values — a child stands firm through every challenge.</p>

  <h2>Common Queries</h2>

  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    At Photon International School, we believe parents deserve <strong>clarity, trust, and transparency</strong> when choosing a school for their child.  
    Below are the most frequent questions families ask — and what makes Photon a <strong>premium choice for your child’s brighter tomorrow.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3><strong>1. What curriculum do you follow?</strong></h3>
  <p>Photon follows the <strong>ICSE curriculum</strong>, one of the most respected and internationally recognised boards.  
  It builds a strong foundation in English, Mathematics, and Science while also nurturing creativity, reasoning, and real-world understanding.  
  Our teaching blends traditional learning with modern experiential methods, ensuring education is both <strong>challenging and enjoyable</strong>.</p>

  <h3><strong>2. What makes Photon different from other schools?</strong></h3>
  <p>We focus on the <strong>overall development</strong> of every child — not just marks.  
  Many schools prioritise high percentages by making exams easier, producing <strong>“high-percentage, low-skill” learners</strong>.  
  At Photon, our mission is different: we build <strong>high-skill, confident, capable individuals</strong> who can think, speak, and lead.  
  We prepare <strong>leaders, not followers</strong>, by strengthening communication, confidence, critical thinking, and values.</p>
  <p>We believe education should be like a <strong>tree with strong roots</strong> — a solid base helps children stand firm through life’s challenges.</p>

  <h3><strong>3. What do you mean by “No-Tuition Culture”?</strong></h3>
  <p>We believe learning should happen <strong>within school hours</strong>, making education stress-free for children and parents.  
  If a student still requires tuition after school, it means the school hasn’t done its job — and at Photon, we take that responsibility seriously.</p>

  <h3><strong>4. How many students are there in each class?</strong></h3>
  <p>Each class has a maximum of <strong>25 students</strong>.  
  This low student–teacher ratio ensures personal attention, active participation, and individual growth — a hallmark of premium education and care.</p>

  <h3><strong>5. What are your teachers like?</strong></h3>
  <p>Our teachers are <strong>qualified, experienced, and deeply passionate</strong> about teaching.  
  Led by Principal <strong>Mrs. Renu Singh</strong>, a former KVS educator with over 25 years of experience, our team focuses on both academic excellence and character building.  
  Regular professional development keeps our teachers updated with the best teaching practices.</p>

  <h3><strong>6. How safe is the school?</strong></h3>
  <p>Student safety and well-being always come first.  
  The campus has <strong>CCTV surveillance, trained security staff, and controlled visitor access</strong>.  
  We conduct regular safety drills and awareness programs so students feel secure and prepared.  
  Classrooms are spacious, well-ventilated, smart-board equipped, and we provide <strong>RO drinking water</strong> to keep every child healthy and comfortable.</p>

  <h3><strong>7. What facilities do you offer?</strong></h3>
  <p>Photon provides <strong>modern facilities</strong> to support both academic and extracurricular growth:  
  digital smart classrooms, science & computer labs, RO water, CCTV, and safe transport.  
  We also prioritise <strong>sports, dance, and creative arts</strong> for true holistic development.</p>

  <h3><strong>Why parents trust Photon</strong></h3>
  <p>Parents choose Photon for our balanced approach — a <strong>premium education</strong> that combines strong academics with life skills, low class sizes, and a caring culture.  
  We don’t chase marks alone; we build <strong>competence, confidence, and character</strong> that lasts a lifetime.</p>
